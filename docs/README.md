This is the official Documentation page for 0x4447, LLC products. On this site you'll find the documentation for all of our products that we have on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=80edcebf-11fb-4c36-a3f4-49eb40b518a3).

## Core Idea behind Our Products

The core idea behind our products is to function with as little management as possible. We have designed them this way so that you can focus on what matters most to you, without having to manage yet another server.

With this purpose in mind, you should not make any changes to the underlying operating system, make manual changes in the configuration etc.

Over time We will provide new features, bug fixes, and updated versions of different packages.

These products should be treated as appliances.
