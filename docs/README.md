This is the official Documentation page for 0x4447, LLC. On this site you'll fin the documentation for all of our products that we have on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=80edcebf-11fb-4c36-a3f4-49eb40b518a3).

## Core Idea of Our Products

The core idea of our products was to design them in a way where there would be as little management as possible. This way you can focus on what matters and not have to manage yet another server.

For this reason you should not make any changes to the underlying operating system, make manual changes in the configuration etc.

We will provide over time updates to add features, fix bugs or update version of different packages.

Thees products should be treaded as  appliances.
